                <h1 class="mb-3 text-warning">Acoustic Guitar</h1>
                <p class="text-light">A fretted musical instrument with a hollow chamber in its body that is filled with vibrating strings is called an acoustic guitar. Although many acoustic guitars can also be used as electric guitars, the vibrations in the air can be heard without the need for electrical amplification.</p>
                <p class="text-light">Acoustic Guitar have steel strings that gives the guitar a much brighter, treble-focused sound. Despite the category name, “steel string” guitars may feature strings made of nickel, aluminum, and other metals.Generally speaking, the necks are rounder and slimmer than those of nylon string guitars. Rosewood is the most common wood used for necks, but pau ferro is also widely used. This category includes most of the acoustic guitars used in rock, folk, country, and bluegrass music.</p>

            <h1 class="mb-3 text-warning">Classical Guitar</h1>
            <p class="text-light">The nylon string guitars of today are very close to the first acoustic guitars. The term "nylon string" refers to Spanish guitars, classical guitars, and all of its derivatives.The massive sound hole in the hollow wood guitars is a feature. Spruce is the most common wood species used for the top panel of guitars, while other species are also utilized.</p>
            <p class="text-light">These guitars typically have wide, flat necks that allow the guitar strings to be spaced fairly far apart. Neck materials also vary, but rosewood is a popular material. Nylon string guitars have a mellow tone with strong resonance in lower-mid frequencies.</p>

                  <h1 class="mb-4 text-warning">Electric Guitar</h1>
                  <p class="text-light">An electric guitar has a wooden body with steel strings strung through it, as well as attached elements like a pickup. The sound is low in loudness when played without amplification, so it is electrically amplified using a device. 
                    Some people might not understand that these guitars are made of wood because of the way their bodies are painted to look like metal or plastic. They are also frequently highly colorful. However, electric guitars are typically built of wood, just like any other type of guitar. The type of material chosen for an electric guitar's body affects the sound that it produces.</p>
                  <p class="text-light">The bodies of electric guitars are embedded with components known as pickups. Vibrations from the strings are converted by pickups into an electric signal that is transmitted via a shielded cable to an amplifier. The electric signal is transformed into sound and played by the amplifier. During this process, the sound's volume and tone are also changed. To put it another way, an electric guitar cannot truly be regarded as a musical instrument unless it has an amplifier.</p>

                  <h1 class="mb-4 text-warning">Bass Guitar</h1>
                  <p class="text-light">A bass guitar is an electric guitar-style plucked string instrument that produces lower frequencies. Its metal bass strings vibrate over one or more magnetic pickups to produce sound (though non-magnetic pickups are also used on occasion). After that, an amplifier receives a signal from the pickups through an instrument cable, enabling the bass to be heard at various loudness levels.</p>
                  <p class="text-light">The majority of bass guitars have four strings, but five-string, six-string, seven-string, and eight-string models are favored by certain players. </p>
